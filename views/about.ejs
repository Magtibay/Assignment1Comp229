     <p>
    I am currently finishing my last semester at Centennial College for Software Engineering. 
    This website was produced for course COMP229 and displays my current and past projects.
    I enjoy working on projects, especially in a team environment, as we are able to share our thoughts and ideas.
    I am looking forward to more opportunities to further improve my skills and knowledge.
